## 🌎 About Me

### **Graduate Researcher @ Johns Hopkins Hydroclimate Research Group | M.S. Student in Environmental Sciences and Policy | 2x NASA DEVELOPer**

👋 My name is Annie Britton and I'm an environmental scientist passionate about digging into Earth science data to explore questions about our planet.

📊 M.S. Thesis - Predicting Relationships between Drought Indicators and Ecological Drought Impacts using Machine Learning and Explainable AI in the Cheyenne River Basin, South Dakota

🛰️ I'm currently working on a NASA-funded project using Earth observations to improve methods available for estimating the health damages of extreme weather events. 

🌱 I'm always working to grow my geospatial and coding skillsets. My technical strengths lie in data analysis and visualization, geospatial analysis, remote sensing, Python, R, Google Earth Engine, GIS, and science communication.
